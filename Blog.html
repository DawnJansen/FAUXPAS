				<h1>BLOGPOST 1: Introduction </h1>
				<p1>Let me introduce myself; My name is Giovanni Peterse, and I’m 24 years old. In my spare try to put all my creativity into music producing. But what is the link between Faux Pas and music producing? In music producing there are a lot of ways to make your idea to reality in sound. A song is never finished, there are lot’s of things you can add to a song or what you can remove. The thing is, even when a song is finished, for one person the song will sound perfect, but for the other one it will not sound perfectly. This means that you can never satisfy 100% of the people, even the people you are focussing on. Even the fans of the music can be disappointed or will have negative comments on what you have put all your creativity and passion in. But the key is to always believe in yourself, and doing what you love the most, regarding what other people have to say about it.</p1>

				<h1>BLOGPOST 2: Body Cofidence</h1>
				<p1>Some people like to wear clothes which would not show any of their body, this will prevent them from being body shamed by other people. A celebrity who is known for doing this is Billie Eilish. She stated in an interview with Calvin Klein: I never want the world to know everything about me, she says. I mean, that’s why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they haven’t seen what’s underneath, you know? She continues, Nobody can be like, ‘Oh, she’s slim-thick, she’s not slim-thick, she’s got a flat (butt), she’s got a fat (butt). No one can say any of that, because they don’t know. Let me know in the comments if you agree with Billie Eilish, or do you think that she should just be herself without being afraid of people body shaming on her?</p1>

				<h1>BLOGPOST 3: Failures lead to Success</h1>
				<p1>Everyone makes mistakes, even the most successful and famous people in the world. Nobody talks about their failures however, because they overcame them and became better. Bill Gates, the richest man on earth, is a perfect example. At the age of 17 he wanted to start up his own company. The goal was to build a hardware device that could read traffic data tapes. On the big reveal day a supervisor from the County of Seattle’s traffic department came to see it and the device failed to work. The business failed before it even got off the ground. The man behind Apple; Steve Jobs went to a lot of problems as well. He dropped out of college to take courses that were interesting to him. In 1976 he co-founded Apple Computers. In 1983, Jobs hired John Scully from Pepsi to helm the company as CEO, then later after a disagreement, he was fired from his own company. After that he founded NeXT, which was thriving. Apple however, was on the verge of bankruptcy. Ultimately, NeXT was acquired by Apple in 1997 and became the company it is today.</p1>
